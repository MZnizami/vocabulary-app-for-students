# vocabulary-app-for-students
- This is a Andriod mobile based app.
- Here we have 5 Boxes that Box 1 is for day one, box 2 is for every 3rd day, box 3 is for once a week, box 4 is for every other week, and box 5 is for once a month.
- Inside Box 1, there are about 15 words added by the instructor. 
- The student should review them and clarify if she/he knows the word then she/he should tap a button which it is moved into box 2. 
- But if she/he doesn't know it, she/he will stay in box 1. This should be done every day and on the 3rd day boxes 1 and 2 will be reviewed. 
- Likewise in box 2, if the student knows the word it moves into box 3 if not it moves back to box 1 and this process is repeated in every box till box 5. 
- In box 5 if the student knows the word it will be removed completely from the list and saved to student's long-term memory.
